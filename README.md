# ETC5513-Assignment-4-Group7

This report will be exploring the crime offenders statistics collected by Australian Bureau of Statistics (https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/4519.02018-19?OpenDocument). Our focus for the analysis is on the gender, age, police proceedings and state distribution of offenders. Therefore, three datasets are selected for the analysis in this case, “Offenders, Australia” , “Offenders, state and territories” and  “Police proceedings, selected states and territories”.
