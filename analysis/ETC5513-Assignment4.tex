\section*{Crime analysis by State and Territory}

In this section, we are exploring the Australian crime statistics between states/territories. The analysis will be exploring which state has the highest crime rates, and what principal offence accounts for a large proportion.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{ETC5513-Assignment4_files/figure-latex/graph1-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:graph1}state-crime}
\end{figure}

The figure above demonstrates high crime cases recorded by NSW, QLD, SA, VIC and WA. However, the high number of crime cases recorded in these states may due to its high population compared to other states/territories like ACT, NT and TAS.

Next, We'd like to look into the frequency of the principal offence in 2018 for top 4 crime-level states. (NSW, QLD, SA and VIC)

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{ETC5513-Assignment4_files/figure-latex/nsw-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:nsw}NSW crime 2018}
\end{figure}

The figure \ref{fig:nsw} demonstrates that 02 Acts intended to cause injury takes the largest proportion in NSW's 2018 crime statistics.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{ETC5513-Assignment4_files/figure-latex/qld-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:qld}QLD crime 2018}
\end{figure}

The figure \ref{fig:qld} demonstrates that 10 Illicit drug offences takes the largest proportion in QLD's 2018 crime statistics. So why some states like QLD have drug offences on rife? Tony Fleming explains in the brisbane times that, ``Largely it is because the Valley and CBD is a night and party precinct. A lot of the drug use is associated with people socialising and whatnot.''\emph{(\textcite{brisbanetimes2019})}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{ETC5513-Assignment4_files/figure-latex/sa-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:sa}SA crime 2018}
\end{figure}

The figure \ref{fig:sa} also represents the outstanding proportion of 10 Illicit drug offences in South Australia's 2018 crime statistics.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{ETC5513-Assignment4_files/figure-latex/vic-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:vic}VIC crime 2018}
\end{figure}

In the figure \ref{fig:vic}, 02 Acts intended to cause injury resulted in the highest proportion compared to other offences recorded in Victoria's crime statistics.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:table}Crime statistics 2018 AU}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{l|r}
\hline
State & Proportion\\
\hline
NSW & 27.8823529\\
\hline
VIC & 20.3036936\\
\hline
QLD & 23.6136799\\
\hline
SA & 11.1898769\\
\hline
WA & 10.7370725\\
\hline
TAS & 2.6268126\\
\hline
NT & 2.9699042\\
\hline
ACT & 0.6766074\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Furthermore, \ref{tab:table} also implies the top 4 states accounted for highest proportion of total crime cases recorded in Australia 2018.

\section*{body 4}
=======
The number and rate of offences in Australia are affected by various factors. In recent year, Australia is continually strengthening law enforcement. Although this can reduce the offence rate, the number of offences is also rising with the continuous increase of the population. This report shows the current status of criminal activity in Australia and changes in criminal activity in terms of age, gender, states or territories, and police proceeding.

In the first section, look at the offenders by age group in Australia. The purpose is to explore the distribution of offenders across age groups, what principal offences account for the majority of the offences in each age group, and the changes in the number of offenders by year. By conducting this analysis, an overview of the distribution and trend of the number of offenders by age group can be obtained.

Although the status of female offence in modern society is more prominent than in the past, it is a recognised fact that in general, under various social systems and historical conditions, the proportion of female offenders in the total number of offenders is significantly lower. At the same time, the gender difference in the number of offences has more significant uncertainty. We will analyse the number and rate of offenders for each gender and explore the yearly changes of the offences on each gender group in the second section.

For section three, we analyse the crime statistics on states or territories in Australia. The intention is to explore how the primary offences take account in each state or territory in 2018, and which state or territory have competitively higher crime rates. By analysing the crime statistics on states or territories, the report will offer insights on how each state or territory differs on the frequency of primary offences recorded.

Furthermore, in the fourth section, we analyse the court actions of offenders in Australia. The purpose of this section is to investigate the distribution of court and non-court actions of offenders in each state, and which specific crime will be resulting in more court actions than non-court actions. By analyse the court actions of the criminal, we also provide some detailed explanations and the possible reason to cause this phenomenon.

\section*{Gender difference in the number and rate of offences}

\includegraphics{ETC5513-Assignment4_files/figure-latex/gender1-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:gender1}Yearly average offence records of different offence type}
\end{figure}

As showing in Figure \ref{fig:gender1}, each bar represents the average number of records for each type of offence and gender over the ten years. The overall offence recorded that the number of male offenders is significantly higher than female offenders. The highest number of offence type for males are ``Acts intended to cause injury'' and for females are ``Theft''.

\begin{table}[H]

\hline
Total & 308136.3 & 90450.5 & Males are 3.41 times higher\\
\hline
\end{tabular}}
\end{table}

If we look at the summary (Refer to Table \ref{tab:gendersumm}), the result also indicates that in all the offence types, the number of male offenders is significantly higher than female offenders. The ``Sexual assault and related offence'' is the most significant difference between the number of males and females, and the average number of males is about 17 times higher than females. The difference in ``Theft'' is relatively minimal; males are about 1.53 times higher than females. Over the ten years, the average number of male offenders is 4.42 times higher than that of females.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{ETC5513-Assignment4_files/figure-latex/gender2-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:gender2}Yearly Number of Offenders on Female and Male}
\end{figure}

From Figure \ref{fig:gender2}, we can observe that the yearly changes on the number of records of most types of the offence are stable on both genders. However, there still have some changes. For females, the number of ``Theft'' drop highly, from about 25,000 reduced to 15,000 and ``Illicit drug offences'' increased by nearly 10,000. For males, although some type offences remain at a relatively high level, ``Unlawful entry with intent and Property damage'' and ``environmental pollution'' have decreased by about 20,000. Government still need to pay attention to the issue of ``Illicit drug offences'', because the number of records has increased a lot compared to 2008.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{ETC5513-Assignment4_files/figure-latex/gender3-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:gender3}Rate of offenders recorded in Australia}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:gender3}, it represents the offender rate on both genders; the rate indicates the number of offenders in 100,000 people. In 2009, the rate was 2,062 offenders in 100,000 people. After the overall trend is decreasing, in 2018, there are about 1,794 offenders in 100,000 people. The rate decreased to their lowest levels in six years.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The crime offender's dataset collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics allows our group to analyse the insight of the crime circumstances in Australia by gender, age group, states/territories, and police proceedings. The number and rate of male offenders recorded in Australia are significantly higher than that of female offenders. Although the number of offences on both genders has increased in recent years, the growth rate in the number of male offenders is lower than that of females. The rate of male offenders has dropped far more than females. Besides, the majority of the proportion of offenders is from younger age groups. One interesting thing is that the number of offences for the age group below 45 decreased in 2018-2019, while it increased for the age group over 45. Even though the total number of offenders differs across age groups, the trend is pretty similar with 10, 2, 13 being the top three highest principal offences. On the other hand, through the visualisations created for crime statistics on states/territories, the report concludes the top 4 states/territories as NSW, QLD, SA, and VIC. The common grounds of these states are, QLD and SA both had `Illicit drug offences' as the most frequent primary offence, whereas, NSW and VIC had `Acts intended to cause injury'. Lastly, it can be clearly concluded that most criminals will be prosecuted by the court in all states. But offenders in SA and TAS have a smaller proportion of criminals result in court action compared to other states. Most types of crime will result in court actions. However, public order offenses and miscellaneous offenses have less possibility to be litigated by the court.
